                Ambition is a desirable skill at work. Think about it; it’ll make you strive to do better, set new
                goals, and stay dedicated to your work. It will even make your resume stand out by showing that you have
                a growth mindset. You’re interested in growing and moving up, not just staying where you are.

                Ambition at work has three categories: performance, growth, and achievement. But what’s key is to find a
                balance between all of them. Well-rounded career ambitions help you be more creative, aid your work-life
                balance, and leave you more satisfied.
